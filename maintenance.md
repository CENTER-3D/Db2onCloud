## Maintenance policy
{: #maintenance}

Effective as of March 27, 2018, in the event that scheduled system maintenance must be done for the {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} service, the major data centers (London, Dallas, and Sydney) are updated on separate days of the business week. All of the other data centers are simultaneously updated on a day of the week that doesn't coincide with the major data centers. Table 1 shows an example of a {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} system maintenance schedule.
