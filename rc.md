# Resource controller (RC)
{: #rc}

The {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_long}} service now supports resource controller (RC). The RC is responsible for controlling and tracking the lifecycle of resources in an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. Resources is a broad term that might mean anything from an instance of a service like {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}}, a Cloud Foundry application, a virtual machine, a container, a software image, a data set, or other entity associated to an account.

## Migrating Cloud Foundry services to RC
{: #mig_cf_rc}

Available with the resource controller is the ability to manage your service and app resources by using *resource groups*. For information about how and why you should migrate your Cloud Foundry service instances and apps to resource groups, see [Migrating Cloud Foundry service instances and apps to a resource group](/docs/resources?topic=resources-migrate).

To be able to use the new features such as IBM Key Protect and Database Copy, you must migrate your Cloud Foundry service instances to RC.
