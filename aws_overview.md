## Db2 on Cloud for Amazon Web Services vs Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) 
{: #aws_rds}

Db2 on Cloud for Amazon Web Services is completely managed by IBM. In addition to autonomously fixing issues, IBM DevOps continuously monitors your server and if it goes down, an IBM DevOps staff member will get it up and running. RDS, on the other hand, provides a framework, but does not provide comprehensive care.
