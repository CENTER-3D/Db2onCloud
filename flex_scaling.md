# Flexible scaling
{: #scale}

Independent scaling of RAM, storage, and compute cores. 
{: shortdesc}

Your Flex plan initially deploys with 1 core, 4 GB of RAM and 2 GB of disk space. You can then scale your plan up or down with slider bars.

These dynamic adjustments typically take less than 20 minutes to complete. You can even scale CPU and RAM without any downtime by following these [guidelines](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/381931/how-can-i-scale-cpu-up-and-down-without-downtime-o.html){:external}.
