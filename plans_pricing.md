## Pricing
{: #pricing}

Prices are stated in monthly terms (for example, $189 USD per month) for an activated service. 

If the activated service is terminated before the month ends, the monthly price reflects the portion of the month during which the service remained activated.

### Billing examples
{: #examples}

In the following billing examples, an example plan charge of $189 USD per month is used.

**Example 1: Monthly billing**

While the service remains activated for each monthly billing period, a charge of $189 USD per month is billed even if the service sits idle.

**Example 2: Daily billing**

Billing for Flex plans is based on peak daily usage. For example, if you scale up from 2 to 8 cores for one hour of a day, you are billed for 8 cores for only that day, and 2 cores for all of the other days of the month.

**Example 3: Prorated billing**

If an activated service with a monthly charge of $189 USD per month was used for 20 days out of the 30 days in the month before the service was terminated, the bill for the usage would be $189 USD x 20/30 = $126 USD.
